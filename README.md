# Tic-Tac-Toe

By [Naimur Rahman](https://github.com/nayeem-rafi)

## Introduction
This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where you, the player, can challenge an AI bot. The bot is designed to make strategic moves, making it a competitive opponent that’s almost impossible to beat. Written in Python, this game is perfect for practicing game logic, Python programming, and basic AI strategies.

## Description
The game is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe where the player competes against an AI bot. The bot is designed to make intelligent moves by detecting winning and blocking opportunities, which creates a more challenging experience. Each game starts with a randomly chosen player to make the first move, and the board updates visually in the console after each turn.

## Features
- **Randomized Turn Order**: The game randomly selects whether the player or the AI starts first.
- **Intelligent AI Bot**: The bot checks for winning moves and blocks the player’s winning moves when possible.
- **Console-Based Visual Board**: The board is displayed after each move for easy tracking of the game.
- **Challenging Gameplay**: The AI’s improved logic makes it difficult to beat, providing an engaging experience.

## Program Analysis
The program is structured as follows:
- **Game Board**: Displayed as a 3x3 grid with numbered positions (1-9) for easy navigation.
- **Move Selection**: Players input their moves based on the grid numbers, while the bot chooses moves based on available spaces and winning conditions.
- **AI Logic**: The bot prioritizes winning moves and blocking moves, making it almost unbeatable.

## Output
The console output includes:
- The game board after each move, showing the positions with player moves marked as `O` and bot moves as `X`.
- Messages indicating the winner (either "You won!" or "I won!") or a tie if no one wins.
